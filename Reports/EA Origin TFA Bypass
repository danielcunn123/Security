Summary

Origin is vulnerable to a multi-factor-authentication bypass when exceeding a time limit upon logging in on a new device.

Base
CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step
CWE-305: Missing Critical Step in Authentication


Description
An attacker can gain access to a 2FA enabled account with only the login credentials.
Continuisly bypassing the verification when logging in at the same location.

Expected
What is expected to occur when logging into Origin on a new device, requires an aditional factor of authentication.

Result
It is possible to log into an EA account on Origin and gain full account takeover without a single email or SMS being sent. 

Long Description
There exists a vulnerability where if a user logs into their account, are greeted with a 2FA page requesting an email or SMS be sent to verify the login. Upon waiting aproximatly 24 hours at this page without requesting verification be sent, the application will crash when pressing any button.
Reopening Origin requires the user to relogin with credentials, Origin will error saying something is wrong and auto-exit crashing one more time, reopening Origin requires user credentials although upon logging in, no 2FA is sent.

This is a flaw with the client-side application timeout causing a few application crashes affecting the login sequence, EA back-end servers accepting unverifed 2FA logins.

The following services are currently affected:
+  Origin (EA app v13.335.0.5848)
-  WebApplication (EA login page https://signin.ea.com)
