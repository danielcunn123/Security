<h3>What is a Software Vulnerability?</h3>

According to MITRE’s CVE Terminology:

A universal vulnerability is a state in a computing system (or set of systems) which either:

    allows an attacker to execute commands as another user
    allows an attacker to access data that is contrary to the specified access restrictions for that data
    allows an attacker to pose as another entity
    allows an attacker to conduct a denial of service
    MITRE believes that when an attack is made possible by a weak or inappropriate security policy, this is better described as ‘exposure’

An exposure is a state in a computing system (or set of systems) which is not a universal vulnerability, but either:

    allows an attacker to conduct information gathering activities
    allows an attacker to hide activities
    includes a capability that behaves as expected, but can be easily compromised
    is a primary point of entry that an attacker may attempt to use to gain access to the system or data is considered a problem according to some reasonable security policy
    When trying to gain unauthorized access to a system, an intruder usually first conducts a routine scan (or investigation) of the target, collects any ‘exposed’ data, and then exploits security policy weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities and exposures are therefore both important points to check when securing a system against unauthorized access.
